imager
======

Script to generate a simple html page with all the images in the folder, ordered by name.

Details
------
It is rather tedious to browse a heavy set of images on any system. More so, if you want to look at the images across devices and when you want to share all images quickly with someone.

Imager (a simple index.php file) is a file that can be dropped into any folder to convert it into webpage that has images with the maximum width supported on the device, pre-loaded for your viewing purposes.
